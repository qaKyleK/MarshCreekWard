        <h3 class="newsTitle">Stake Temple Day Announcement!</h3>
    <p class="parag">Dear Brothers and Sisters,
        <br>We recently had the opportunity to hear our prophet, Russel M Nelson, speak to the California Saints directly.  In that message he encouraged us to:
        <li class="parag">Seek Truth</li>
        <li class="parag">Make and Keep Covenants</li>
        <li class="parag">Gather Israel</li>
    <div class="parag">
        <br>The Antioch Stake has set aside some time that might help us all begin to act on the prophet’s counsel.  Our Antioch Stake Temple Day is planned for April 15th, and we would like to encourage you to make an effort to attend that day or anytime that week as you are able.  Attending the Temple exposes us to the single source of truth, reminds us of covenants we have made, and helps to gather Israel on both sides of the veil.  That's all 3 in one trip.  A quote from Pres. Nelson:” as covenant children of God, give Him a fair share of your time every day.  As you do you will learn about His power to comfort, strengthen, renew, and heal you”.
        <br>Making an effort to attend the temple will also open our hearts and minds to receive more of what the Lord would have us hear at Stake Conference immediately following on April 16th – 17th. 
        
        Appointments typically book out quickly, so now is the perfect time to schedule your visit.
        
        Two ways to schedule.  Best is using the link below.  Or, call the temple at 510-531-3200.</p>

        <p class="parag">Reminder to please check the status of your temple recommend and if needed, please renew.
    <br>
    <br>Thank you, and see you on the 15th of April!
